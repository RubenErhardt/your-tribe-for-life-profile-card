# Your-Tribe-For-Life-Profile-Card 🪪
Welcome to my repository of Your-Tribe-For-Life-Profile-Card. I had to make a profile card using Sveltekit for the first time. 

## Features ❇️
- **Responsive Design:** The design adjusts to various screen sizes for an optimal user experience on both mobile devices and desktops.
- **Fast and Responsive UI**: Built with Svelte for a high-performance user experience.
- **Improved Performance:** Optimizations such as lazy loading and optimized images ensure fast load times.
- **Unique Design/Idea:** The design and overall concept of this project are centered around the theme of Call of Duty. 
The visual elements, layout, and styling draw inspiration from the game's aesthetic. Because I love COD 🎮
- **Accessibility**: Designed with accessibility in mind.
